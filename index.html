              Energy-the necessity.
            </h2>
            <p class = "text">
            Energy is not only the future in today's society; it also drives everything in the present. As a global civilization, we create and use more energy than ever before, and the need for energy is always growing. While we have been able to increase energy production to meet demand, there are physical, geographical, and economic constraints on how much can be generated.

              Rethink the basics.
            </h2>
            <p class = "text">
              With the world's population growing and industrialization spreading in emerging countries, humanity's thirst for energy has reached unparalleled proportions. More than half of our energy is derived from fossil fuels found deep below the Earth's crust. Scientists worldwide believe that we are on a collision course with a calamity that can only be avoided by weaning ourselves off of our reliance on fossil fuels.

              Time to change, time to sustain.
            </h2>
            <p class = "text">
              Given that energy cannot be generated or destroyed, energy conservation focuses on preserving rather than eradicating it. Turning down things that demand a lot of heat or energy is one of the most efficient ways to save energy. Some gadgets should be turned off altogether since they use energy even when not in use. While it is preferable to turn down the heat rather than turn it off (since places must be heated to some degree), many appliances and equipment should be disconnected or switched off when not in use.
